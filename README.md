NOTE: This library is in the process of being replaced.


A simple library to adjust color saturation of X11 outputs.

vibrant, with it's library libvibrant and it's command-line tool vibrant-cli, allows you to adjust the color saturation on X11 outputs, as long as the CTM property is supported.

# Usage
```bash
$ vibrant-cli OUTPUT [SATURATION]
```
Get or set saturation of output.

`OUTPUT` is the name of the X11 output. You can find this by running `xrandr`.
`SATURATION` is a floating point value between (including) 0.0 and (including) 4.0.
- `0.0` or `0` means monochrome
- `1.0` or `1` is normal color saturation (100%)
- if empty the saturation will not be changed

## Examples
### 150% on DisplayPort-0
```bash
$ vibrant-cli DisplayPort-0 1.5
```

### Monochrome on DisplayPort-0
```bash
$ vibrant-cli DisplayPort-0 0
```

### Reset DisplayPort-0
```bash
$ vibrant-cli DisplayPort-0 1
```

### Only query current saturation on DisplayPort-0
```bash
$ vibrant-cli DisplayPort-0
```

# Compatibility
vibrant supports most modern GPUs.
## AMD GPUs
- Your card needs to be supported by the AMD Display Code kernel driver

## NVIDIA GPUs
- Currently only the NVIDIA proprietary driver is supported
- Support is handled by libXNVCtrl, which should be bundled with most installations of the driver

## Confirmed working
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660
- Radeon RX 5700 XT
- Radeon RX 5600 XT
- Radeon VII
- Radeon RX Vega 56
- Radeon RX 580
- Radeon RX 470
- Radeon R9 270
